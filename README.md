# IOT_based_pulse_oximeter
This project implements an Internet of Things (IoT) based Pulse Oximeter, utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller. The system provides real-time monitoring of vital signs, specifically blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate. The ESP8266 acts as an HTML web server, enabling users to access a dedicated webpage for instant readings. The project aims to streamline healthcare monitoring by leveraging IoT technology, allowing for remote patient data access. It incorporates an intuitive user interface for easy interpretation of health metrics. Explore this repository to set up your own IoT-based Pulse Oximeter and enhance healthcare accessibility.
